# WordCrowRelease

This repository contains the Windows application and android apk.

You may click on code and download as zip to acquire the files and use them as you see fit. For Windows, you need only run the executable as long as all the other stuff in the foler are there along with it. For android, I assume all phones should have a built in package installer. You just need to transfer the apk to your phone and install it. If the phone complains, you may need to change a setting to allow apk installations from unknown sources.
