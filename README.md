# WordCrowRelease

This repository contains the Windows application and android apk.

You may click on the green 'Code' button and 'Download as zip' to acquire all the files in one go and use them as you see fit. 

Alternatively, you may directly download just the Windows Zip Folder or the Android APK file respectively.

The Windows application folder is available here if perhaps you have Github installed and would rather just clone it directly without having to unzip stuff.

For Windows, you need only run the executable as long as all the other stuff in the foler are there along with it.

For android, I assume all phones should have a built in package installer. You just need to transfer the apk to your phone and install it. If the phone complains, you may need to change a setting to allow apk installations from unknown sources.
